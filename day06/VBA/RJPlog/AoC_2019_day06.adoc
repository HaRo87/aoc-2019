== Day 6: Universal Orbit Map

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6

This day for part 1 I had to start with recursive algorithms to evaluate the direct and indirect orbits. 
Since my puzzle input included 2603 relations and the middle length of the orbits was 239, it took more than 3 hours to calculate in Excel VBA, so this is a real disadvantage.
But the VBA programming hat also a big advantage, it was easy to develop the algorithm, so that I had the 3 hours only once ;-), with this times of calculation you have to be carefull.
