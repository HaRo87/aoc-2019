== 1202 Program Alarm

I have written my solutions in Haskell. I am using this year's Advent of Code to
brush up on my functional programming.

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`runhaskell answer.hs`.

My solution for part 1 defines a recursive function `comp`, that computes a single step of
the computer and then continues to call itself with the next instruction address
until it encounters an error or the halt opcode, `99`.

My solution for part 2 defines a recursive function `findParams`, that checks to
see if a set of params results in the expected output. If it doesn't, it calls
itself with the parameters updated accordingly, and runs until the desired
output is found.
