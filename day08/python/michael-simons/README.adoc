:tags: list comprehension, unpacking

I think that's maybe the second or third time I ever actively used Python.
Significant spaces: Is this YAML in disguise ;)?

The solution is build on https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/textwrap.html[textwrap] to split the string at a fixed width.

<1> Create the layers by wrapping the input at the given dimension
<2> Create a sorted copy of that list (by the count of `0`)
<3> I use a dictionary for translating the image value
<4> Start with a transparent image as mask.
    Again. we find a _list comprehension_ during AoC
<5> Here, we wrap the final image, this time at the width and than join those lines together by `\n`

The image mask array could have been generated by unpacking the list like this `[*map(lambda item: "2", range(d))]`, but I like the list comprehension more.

NOTE: Run with `python3 Solution.py`.
      Tested with `Python 3.7.0`
