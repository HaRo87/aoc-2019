== Solution written in Java

This is just a setup-test. To build:

    mvn clean install

To run:

   java -jar target/aoc-2018-day01-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

== Solution

To skip parsing the data, I've pasted the input directly into the programm as a list of integers.

=== Part 1

Simply sum the list using a stream collector.

=== Part 2

Keep track of reached frequencies using a set. Cycle over the data. Break the cycle when the set of reached frequencies already contains currently reached frequency.
