== Sensor Boost

I have written my solutions in Haskell. I am using this year's Advent of Code to
brush up on my functional programming.

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

This solution extends my Day 07 solution by adding an parameter mode to treat a
parameter as a relative memory offset from a base.
